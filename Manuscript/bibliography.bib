title = {Neighborhood choice and neighborhood change},
abstract = {This article examines the relationships between the residential choices of individuals and aggregate segregation patterns. Analyses based on computational models show that high levels of segregation occur only when individuals' preferences follow a threshold function. If individuals make finer-grained distinctions among neighborhoods that vary in racial composition, preferences alone do not lead to segregation. Vignette data indicate that individuals respond in a continuous way to variations in the racial makeup of neighborhoods rather than to a threshold. Race preferences alone may be insufficient to account for the high levels of segregation observed in American cities. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title = {Residential Preferences and Neighborhood Racial Segregation: A Test of the Schelling Segregation Model},
abstract = {The debate over the role of the forces that create the patterns of residential separation has identified neighborhood preferences as one of the explanatory variables, but although we possess some empirical data on the nature of neighborhood racial preferences, the theoretical contributions have received only limited empirical evaluation. Among the theoretical statements, Schelling's model of the effects of small differences in preferences on residential patterns has provided a basic building block in our understanding of preferences, choices, and patterns. Several recent surveys of residential preferences provide the data with which to evaluate the underpinnings of the Schelling model. The preference/tolerance schedules that are derived from the data have a different functional form from that suggested by Schelling, but confirm the view that stable integrated equilibria are unlikely.},

title = {Urban skylines from Schelling model},
abstract = {We propose a metapopulation version of the Schelling model where two kinds of agents relocate themselves, with unconstrained destination, if their local fitness is lower than a tolerance threshold. We show that, for small values of the latter, the population redistributes highly heterogeneously among the available places. The system thus stabilizes on these heterogeneous skylines after a long quasi-stationary transient period, during which the population remains in a well mixed phase. Varying the tolerance passing from large to small values, we identify three possible global regimes: microscopic clusters with local coexistence of both kinds of agents, macroscopic clusters with local coexistence (soft segregation), macroscopic clusters with local segregation but homogeneous densities (hard segregation). The model is studied numerically and complemented with an analytical study in the limit of extremely large node capacity.},

abstract = {The checkerboard model is a computer simulation of social interaction among members of two groups. The checkerboard represents a social field on which two groups of checkers move on the board on the basis of positive, neutral or negative attitudes toward one another assigned to them. The resulting pattern of positions of the pieces represents the social structure. The theoretical basis for the checkerboard model is explained and the rules for operating the model are outlined. This is followed by illustrative runs named Crossroads, Mutual Suspicion, Segregation, Social Climber, Social Worker, Boy-Girl, Couples and Husband-Wives, showing intermediate and final positions on the board for each. It is concluded that the checkerboard model is capable of demonstrating the intimate connection between attitudes of group members toward their own group and toward others to a continuous social interactional process and to the resulting social structure.},

title = {Heterogeneity extends criticality},
abstract = {Frontiers in Complex Systems 1, 1111486 (2023) Criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for the emergence of complexity,
life, and computation, as it exhibits a balance between robustness and
adaptability. In classic models of complex systems where structure and dynamics
are considered homogeneous, criticality is restricted to phase transitions,
leading either to robust (ordered) or adaptive (chaotic) phases in most of the
parameter space. Many real-world complex systems, however, are not homogeneous.
Some elements change in time faster than others, with slower elements (usually
the most relevant) providing robustness, and faster ones being adaptive.
Structural patterns of connectivity are also typically heterogeneous,
characterized by few elements with many interactions and most elements with
only a few. Here we take a few traditionally homogeneous dynamical models and
explore their heterogeneous versions, finding evidence that heterogeneity
extends criticality. Thus, parameter fine-tuning is not necessary to reach a
phase transition and obtain the benefits of (homogeneous) criticality. Simply
adding heterogeneity can extend criticality, making the search/evolution of
complex systems faster and more reliable. Our results add theoretical support
for the ubiquitous presence of heterogeneity in physical, social, and
technological systems, as natural selection can exploit heterogeneity to evolve
complexity "for free". In artificial systems and biological design,
heterogeneity may also be used to extend the parameter range that allows for
criticality.},

title = {Agent Heterogeneity Mediates Extremism in an Adaptive Social Network Model},
abstract = {An existing model of opinion dynamics on an adaptive social network is
extended to introduce update policy heterogeneity, representing the fact that
individual differences between social animals can affect their tendency to
form, and be influenced by, their social bonds with other animals. As in the
original model, the opinions and social connections of a population of model
agents change due to three social processes: conformity, homophily and
neophily. Here, however, we explore the case in which each node's
susceptibility to these three processes is parameterised by node-specific
values drawn independently at random from some distribution. This introduction
of heterogeneity increases both the degree of extremism and connectedness in
the final population (relative to comparable homogeneous networks) and leads to
significant assortativity with respect to node update policy parameters as well
as node opinions. Each node's update policy parameters also predict properties
of the community that they will belong to in the final network configuration.
These results suggest that update policy heterogeneity in social populations
may have a significant impact on the formation of extremist communities in
real-world populations.},

In this paper a theorem is presented which shows, under very broad conditions, that any regulator that is maximally both successful and simple must be isomorphic with the system being regulated. (The exact assumptions are given.) Making a model is thus necessary.
The theorem has the interesting corollary that the living brain, so far as it is to be successful and efficient as a regulator for survival, must proceed, in learning, by the formation of a model (or models) of its environment.},

abstract = {A quantitative measure of "information" is developed which is based on physical as contrasted with psychological considerations. How the rate of transmission of this information over a system is limited by the distortion resulting from storage of energy is discussed from the transient viewpoint. The relation between the transient and steady state viewpoints is reviewed. It is shown that when the storage of energy is used to restrict the steady state transmission to a limited range of frequencies the amount of information that can be transmitted is proportional to the product of the width of the frequency-range by the time it is available. Several illustrations of the application of this principle to practical systems are included. In the case of picture transmission and television the spacial variation of intensity is analyzed by a steady state method analogous to that commonly used for variations with time.},

abstract = {Although cultural integration, or sharing a common corporate culture, is crucial for the success of mergers, previous studies have been limited to firm-level analyses. From a social network perspective, this study explores how cultural integration emerges from the patterns of social interactions among individuals. Using an agent-based model, we investigate the impact of network structures within and between two merging firms on post-merger cultural integration and organizational dysfunctions—individual turnover, interpersonal conflict and organizational communication ineffectiveness—that arise from insufficient cultural integration. The simulation results demonstrate that the highest level of cultural integration is achieved when social ties are more centralized within each merging firm and the social ties between the merging firms are less concentrated on central individuals. Additionally, the results show that within-firm and between-firm network structures significantly affect individual turnover, interpersonal conflict and organizational communication ineffectiveness, and that these three outcome measurements do not vary in tandem.},

title = {Thomas C. Schelling and James M. Sakoda: The Intellectual, Technical, and Social History of a Model},
abstract = {The Journal of Mathematical Sociology (JMS) started in 1971. The second issue contained its most cited article: Thomas C. Schelling, “Dynamic Models of Segregation”. In that article, Schelling presented a family of models, one of which became a canonical model. To date it is called the Schelling model-an eponym that affixes the inventor’s name to the invention, one of the highest forms of scientific recognition. In the very first issue of JMS, James Minoru Sakoda published an article entitled “The Checkerboard Model of Social Interaction”. Sakoda’s article more or less went unrecognized. Yet, a careful comparison demonstrates that in a certain sense the Schelling model is just an instance of Sakoda’s model. A precursor of that model was already part of Sakoda’s 1949 dissertation submitted to the University of California at Berkeley. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that in the 1970s Sakoda was well known and recognized as a computational social scientist, whereas Schelling was an unknown in the field. A generation later, the pattern of recognition almost completely reversed: Sakoda had become the unknown, while Schelling was the well-known inventor of the pioneering Schelling model. This article explains this puzzling pattern of recognition. Technical and social factors play a decisive role. Some contrafactual historical reflection suggests that the final result was not inevitable.},

abstract = {Today there are no longer segregation laws that once existed in many states in the 20th century and were dismantled as a result of Brown v. Board of Education1 and subsequent federal decisions, laws, and enforcement action, making the legal distinction that prevents action against nonstatutory segregation even more powerful.[...]in late 20th century cases, jurisprudence regarding de jure segregation began accepting that segregation that remained might be due to "private" actions in ways that differed from earlier understandings.2 We investigate the phenomenon of de facto segregation, segregation that does not result from overt laws; this segregation is at the root of existing inequality.3 In particular, we focus on understanding the conceptualization of de facto segregation as whether it is actionable or not actionable by judicial remedies.[...]our review of lower court cases outside the South from the 1960s to early 1980s, an active time for federal intervention into desegregation, finds considerable murkiness about what constitutes judicial determinations of de facto or de jure segregation and whether or not de facto segregation is actionable.[...]we review the mixed record of what type of segregation was considered to be actionable as compared to not actionable.A. An Interbranch Construction of the De Jure/De Facto Distinction 1964-1973 The Supreme Court was largely silent for more than a decade after Brown II remanded segregation back to district courts to fashion remedies appropriate to the local contexts.17 That Brown II long delayed the implementation of meaningful desegregation is without question.18 This delay meant that lower courts were without guidance, and the halting progress, in part, spurred the passage of the Civil Rights Act a decade after Brown,19 In such a vacuum-particularly when considering that many sitting district court judges were themselves products of segregated schooling-movement to desegregate was slow.},

abstract = {The Schelling model has become a paradigm in social sciences to explain the emergence of residential spatial segregation, even in the presence of high tolerance to mixed neighborhoods by the side of citizens. In particular, we consider a noisy constrained version of the Schelling model, in which agents maximize its satisfaction, related to the composition of the local neighborhood, by infinite-range movements towards satisfying vacancies. We add to it an aging effect by making the probability of agents to move inversely proportional to the time they have been satisfied in their present location. This mechanism simulates the development of an emotional attachment to a location where an agent has been satisfied for a while. The introduction of aging has several major impacts on the model statics and dynamics: the phase transition between a segregated and a mixed phase of the original model disappears, and we observe segregated states with a high level of agent satisfaction even for high values of tolerance. In addition, the new segregated phase is dynamically characterized by a slow power-law coarsening process similar to a glassy-like dynamics.},

abstract = {Since the development of the original Schelling model of urban segregation, several enhancements have been proposed, but none have considered the impact of mobility constraints on model dynamics. Recent studies have shown that human mobility follows specific patterns, such as a preference for short distances and dense locations. This paper proposes a segregation model incorporating mobility constraints to make agents select their location based on distance and location relevance. Our findings indicate that the mobility-constrained model produces lower segregation levels but takes longer to converge than the original Schelling model. We identified a few persistently unhappy agents from the minority group who cause this prolonged convergence time and lower segregation level as they move around the grid centre. Our study presents a more realistic representation of how agents move in urban areas and provides a novel and insightful approach to analyzing the impact of mobility constraints on segregation models. We highlight the significance of incorporating mobility constraints when policymakers design interventions to address urban segregation.},

abstract = {We present a mathematical link between Schelling's socio-economic model of segregation and the physics of clustering. We replace the economic concept of "utility" by the physics concept of a particle's internal energy. As a result cluster dynamics is driven by the "surface tension" force. The resultant segregated areas can be very large and can behave like spherical "liquid" droplets or as a collection of static clusters in "frozen" form. This model will hopefully provide a useful framework for studying many spatial economic phenomena that involve individuals making location choices as a function of the characteristics and choices of their neighbors.},

abstract = {The Schelling model of segregation has been shown to have a simulation trace which decreases the entropy of its states as the aggregate number of residential agents surrounded by a threshold of equally labeled agents increases. This introduces a paradox which goes against the second law of thermodynamics that states how entropy must increase. In the efforts to bring principles of physics into the modeling of sociological phenomena this must be addressed. A modification of the model is introduced where a monetary variable is provided to the residential agents (sampled from reported income data), and a dynamic which acts upon this variable when an agent changes its location on the grid. The entropy of the simulation over the iterations is estimated in terms of the aggregate residential homogeneity and the aggregate income homogeneity. The dynamic on the monetary variable shows that it can increase the entropy of the states over the simulation. The path of the traces with both variables in the results show that the shape of the region of entropy is followed supporting that the decrease of entropy due to the residential clustering has a parallel and independent effect increasing the entropy via the monetary variable.},
